				<p><span class="illumination">Hi.</span>My name is Michael, but most of my friends just call me Daross. I'm a developer who is also a designer. (A Designveloper? A Devsiner?)</p>
				<p>I do web stuff &#8212; from layout, branding, and UX design, to front-end develoment, all the way through to the server and database layers. (This site, for example, was built using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)" target="_blank">MEAN stack</a>.) I used to do Flash, but I don't anymore unless you pay me <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/13/c6/65/13c6650ba7ca22208ffcbd4f29e30074.jpg">lots of money</a>.</p>

				<p>Check out the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section to see examples of work I've done recently, or <a href="/contact">Contact</a> me.</p>
				<p>For fun, I write songs and play guitar in a band called <a href="http://www.thunderpony.com" target="_blank">Thunderpony</a>, which &#8212; you can tell from the name &#8212; is a very serious endeavor. I also train a bit in <a href="http://www.mebjj.com" target="_blank">Brazillian jiu-jitsu</a>, and I dabble in writing fiction.</p>
